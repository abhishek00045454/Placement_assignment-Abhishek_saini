    "The Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) measures the average absolute deviation of each data point from the mean. It provides a measure of the average distance between each data point and the mean. In this case, the MAD for \"Blood Pressure Before\" is 6.496, indicating that, on average, the individual data points deviate from the mean by approximately 6.496 mmHg. Similarly, the MAD for \"Blood Pressure After\" is 4.800, indicating an average deviation of approximately 4.800 mmHg.\n",

In this case, the SD for \"Blood Pressure Before\" is 7.491, indicating that the data points are, on average, approximately 7.491 mmHg away from the mean. Similarly, the SD for \"Blood Pressure After\" is 5.610, suggesting that the data points deviate by around 5.610 mmHg from the mean.\n",
